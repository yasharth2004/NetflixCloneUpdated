## 📖 About the Project

This project is an educational exercise in frontend web development. The goal was to recreate the Netflix landing page layout, focusing on positioning, flexbox, CSS grid, and typography to achieve a design that matches the original site.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3** (Flexbox, Grid, Positioning)
* **Google Fonts** (Poppins, Martel Sans)

## ✨ Key Features

* **Authentic UI:** Closely mimics the color palette (Netflix Red #E50914) and dark theme.
* **Video-in-Image Overlay:** Simulates the Netflix effect where a video plays inside the frame of a TV/Monitor image.
* **Styled FAQ Section:** Custom styled accordion layout.
* **Responsive Typography:** Uses viewport units for scalable text.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Since this is a static website, no backend or compilation is required.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yasharth2004/NetflixCloneUpdated.git
cd netflix-clone
```

### 2. Add Assets

Make sure you have the required images and video files inside the `images` and `videos` folders respectively.

### 3. Run the project

* Simply double-click `index.html` to open it in your default web browser.
* OR use the "Live Server" extension in VS Code for hot-reloading.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

Here are a few things that could be added to make this project even better:

* **Responsiveness:** Add CSS Media Queries (`@media`) to make the layout adapt perfectly to mobile phones.
* **JavaScript Interactivity:** Add JS to make the FAQ accordion buttons clickable.
* **Form Validation:** Add simple validation to the email input fields.
